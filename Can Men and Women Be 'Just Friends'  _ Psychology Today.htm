        <div class="field__item"><p>Welcome back to <a title="The Attraction Doctor" href="http://attractiondoctor.com/" target="_blank">The Attraction Doctor</a></p>
<p>I have previously published two articles on the "friend zone" - the area of mismatched romantic or sexual expectations between friends. In the first article, I shared some possible techniques to escape the friend zone and potentially turn from friend to boyfriend or girlfriend (see <a title=" From Friend to Girlfriend or Boyfriend" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-attraction-doctor/201112/escape-the-friend-zone-friend-girlfriend-or-boyfriend" target="_blank">here</a>). In the second article, I discussed this problem a bit more, sharing tips on how to avoid the friend zone in the first place (see <a title=" Becoming a Girlfriend or Boyfriend" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-attraction-doctor/201302/avoiding-the-friend-zone-becoming-girlfriend-or-boyfriend" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Both of those articles received a good deal of commentary and stirred debate. Generally, that debate centered on whether men and women, particularly, can be "just friends". Overall, the comments suggested that men and women might have very different <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/motivation" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at goals">goals</a> and motives for "<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/friends" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at friendship">friendship</a>". Each looks at the responsibilities in friendship and love a bit differently. As a result, they tend to co-create this friend zone confusion.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my curiosity was piqued. So, I took a look in the research literature on men and women being friends. Here is what I found...</p>
<h2><strong>Research on Inter-Sexual Friendship</strong></h2>
<p>Apparently this "just friends" question was pondered by others beginning about a decade ago. Bleske and Buss (2000) surveyed college students regarding the benefits and costs of opposite <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/sex" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at sex">sex</a> friendships in their lives. In general, many of these benefits and costs were the same for both men and women. For example, both sexes enjoyed opposite-sex friends for dinner companions, conversation partners, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/self-esteem" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at self-esteem">self-esteem</a> boosts, information about the opposite sex, social status, respect, and sharing resources. Both sexes also noted some similar costs of opposite-sex friendship, such as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/jealousy" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at jealousy">jealousy</a>, confusion over the status of the relationship, love not being reciprocated, cruel or mean behaviors, and being less attractive to other potential daters because of the friendship.</p>
<p>Male and female responses did differ on a few key items though. Men were more likely to see sex and romantic potential in an opposite sex friend as a benefit (women primarily saw it as a cost). As a result, men were also more likely than women to say that they had sex with an opposite sex friend (22% vs. 11%). Men were also more likely to report friendship costs of lowered self-worth and giving time to help the friend, while women found their own inability to reciprocate the male's attraction as costly. Therefore, when friendships did not turn sexual or romantic, men were often left feeling rejected and used (i.e. "friend zoned"), while women felt uncomfortable with the unequal attraction. In contrast, when friendships did turn romantic/sexual, some of these men continued to label the women as "just friends" - at about double the rate of women. This leads to the "other" friend zone women more routinely face, the "friends-with-benefits zone", where sex is shared but commitment is not reciprocated.</p>
<p>Women also had their own unique costs and benefits of opposite-sex friendships. They were more likely to experience the benefit of their male friends paying for outings and enjoyed the physical protection of those friends (men saw these as costs of time and money). Women also enjoyed the ability to network through male friends. However, as noted above, women found it costly when those male friends desired sex or romance. They also disliked when their male friends caused difficulty in the women's other <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/mating" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at dating">dating</a> efforts.</p>
<h2><strong>Revisiting the Friend Zone and Friendship Problems</strong></h2>
<p>The research above supports the notion that men and women may sometimes have very different goals and desires in opposite-sex friendships. Although both may sometimes be looking for a companion and nothing more, on other occasions, plans may differ. More specifically, men appear to be more likely to look at opposite sex friends as potential sexual and romantic partners. Women, in contrast, tend to prefer non-sexual friendships, which provide protection and resources.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, each sex sees the other's benefit as their own cost. Thus, women tend to find it costly and onerous when male friends desire sex and romance. Men, in contrast, find the time and money demands costly and frustrating, particularly when their romantic desires are not reciprocated. So, due to the mismatched desires, we have the makings of friendship difficulties.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the "friend zone"? As I have said before, the friend zone is essentially an unequal relationship, where the desires of both friends are not equally met. It may exist in a "just friends" context, where resources are being shared (usually gratifying the woman's needs), but sex and romance is not an option (usually frustrating the man). A mismatch can also occur in a "friends-with-benefits" context, where sex is being shared (usually satisfying the man), but resources and protection are not forthcoming (usually frustrating the woman).</p>
<p>Although these patterns are the most common, however, it is important to note that either sex can experience either situation. Some women may desire no-strings-attached sex with a friend. Some men may desire a long-term relationship with a hook-up buddy. The important thing to remember is the MISMATCH in goals. The trade is not equally satisfying for both friends.</p>
<p>Keeping that point in mind leads to the solution...</p>
<h2><strong>Tips for Negotiating a Satisfying Opposite-Sex Friendship</strong></h2>
<p>The research above (and many people's experience) shows that it may often be hard for men and women to be friends. They often have very different expectations for what that "friendship" will entail. However, there is some common ground. So, with a bit of effort, satisfying friendships can be created (at least in some situations).</p>
<p><strong>1) Understand different friendship needs.</strong> It is common for people to think about what they want only. They may even think what they desire is somehow more noble, important, or urgent. That simply is not the case.</p>
<p>When entering into any relationship, even a simple friendship, what others desire may be different. Each person's goals for the friendship may be unique. Some people want companionship, others resources. Some want sex, others commitment. To have a friendship of any kind, it is important to respect those differences. Don't let anyone <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/embarrassment" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at shame">shame</a> you out of your desires. Don't do it to your "friends" in return either.</p>
<p><strong>2) Communicate your intentions. </strong>Frustration and difficulty starts when both individuals are not honest about their goals. For example, a man may claim he desires only companionship, when he really wants a girlfriend. Or, a woman may hook-up, when she really desires to be dined, protected, and dated. Without knowing, their "friends" may not take care of those needs (taking them at their word and deed).</p>
<p>So, if you want something specific out of a friendship, it is important to show it. That may mean a conversation and asking questions. It may also mean acting more like a "boyfriend" or "girlfriend" than a simple friend from the start, making sexual or commitment requests early on. For example, some men say that "they don't pay for outings, unless a woman is looking to be their girlfriend". Some women communicate that "they don't <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/sleep" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at sleep">sleep</a> with men who are not interested in a longer relationship". Yet others talk about their pre-existing "boyfriend" or "girlfriend", letting others know that "friendship only" is available.</p>
<p>In any case, it is important for both parties to be clear what will and will not be part of the "friendship". It is essential to communicate your desires and listen to those of others.</p>
<p><strong>3) Only stay with fair trades. </strong>Sometimes both "friends" are looking to slowly lead to love and commitment. Other times, both are looking for some sexual benefits too. Yet others share only a mutual desire for company, conversation, and mutual support. All of these are good foundations for satisfying (and frustration free) opposite-sex friends. Most often, these will occur when both individuals have the same desires for love and sex with a friend. These balanced and satisfying friendships are also likely to occur in situations where both friends have their own needs for love, sex, resources, and protection met from a separate girlfriend or boyfriend.</p>
<p>With other friendships, desires may not match up so well. In those situations, costs mount, frustrations rise, and hard feelings result. Therefore, it is often best to end those friendships early for all involved. When you find yourself wanting more in a friendship (or hookup) and that desire is not reciprocated, walk away. Similarly, when you don't want more, but your friend does, cut them loose. In either case, failing to act, or convincing others to stay against their needs, will only bring you costs. So, save yourself the frustration of pouring time and money into a lost cause. Or, be sure to let that love-sick friend down quickly, before they ruin your other relationships and make you feel bad.</p>
<p>Nothing you hope to gain from a short-term, unequal friendship will be worth the costs that eventually show up. So, when the exchange is not equal, even if it is initially in your favor, end it. Walk away before the negative consequences add up. Only stay with friends who feel the same.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Can men and women be just friends? In many cases, the answer is no. Sometimes that is good thing, when both people see friendship as a step to mutually-satisfying love, sex, and/or commitment. At other times, men and women cannot be "just" friends because only one friend desires something more. Those mismatched desires between men and women lead to unequal friend zone situations, where one person's needs are completely satisfied at the other's expense. Those unfortunate instances and the frustrations around them are the friendship problems we hear so much about.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, friendship between men and women is not impossible. However, it does require finding someone with friendship goals matching your own. Communicating clearly and leaving when there is not a match is key. Also, if you desire "just friends", then it may be better to pick only friends who are already in other <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/relationships" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at romantic relationships">romantic relationships</a>. That way, you can have a satisfying exchange, a good friend, and no frustration.</p>

I'm glad you have discussed this topic! I have identified with a few things here!  I have been in scenarios - where I got pushed into, or I pushed into Just Friends, Friends with Benefits, and Having a Girlfriend. All three - I have had conversations about the "relationship."  I am convinced that there will always be a disparity - one wants more than the other, despite what either party says. What I really want is an amazing girlfriend in an open, fun relationship. I feel only then can I be fully honest, and vulnerable with my doubts and flaws. What are your thoughts on this?</div>

        <div class="field__item">Wojoman,

Thanks for the comments. I agree that there is indeed often a mismatch and disparity in relationship desires. That is why it is so important to communicate and negotiate. Small differences can be dealt with through discussion, sharing, bartering, and a bit of persuasion/influence. Larger, "irreconcilable" ones spell the end of a mutually-satisfying interaction.

Given that, I believe having what you desire is possible...provided that you are willing and able to satisfy those same desires in your future girlfriend. That will take continued effort on both of your parts. When you do find someone with similar goals and are able to satisfy each other, however, the relationship exchange does tend to be very stable over time.

Remember too that flaws and doubts are often costs to the other person. Those too are shared or exchanged. In other words, if you are going to share yours...find someone who desires to share their own back and respect their vulnerability too. Balance both the fun and the flaws with each other.</div>

        <div class="field__item">all I hear from this article is men thinking friendship is a means to a relationship but only if that person is female.

Maybe men need to learn about relationships in general or stop the hypocritical thought process that they go through.

men seem to have NO PROBLEM identifying and categorizing a friendship when that friendship is with a man. When men are friends with other men they are not using it as a means to an end so they don't feel used when that end never comes. So to say that men can be friends with women is ridiculous (actually worthy of ridicule) when all the evidence shows that no man has wanted a friendship with a woman, and that the friendship was just a means to get what that man really wanted. THAT is NOT friendship. 

In my experience when women become friends with men, they have the same expectations of those men as they do with their female friends. They expect time spent together; ideas, thoughts and feelings shared; enjoy eachothers company. They expect this from men as they do their female friends.

Men on the other hand have expectations for what a friendship should be based on whether that friend is male or female.(men have never expected sex from their male friends the way they do their female friends. ask them, they'll tell you)  They will never be able to treat a person according to the relationship they have with that person and instead treat their relationship according to what's between the person's legs. Men are just naturally sexist I guess. Maybe one day they will become enlightened.  I will not hold my breath. 

Male Logic:
Friendship = Human Companionship
Female =/= Human
THEREFORE
Female =/= friendship</div>

        <div class="field__item">Frustrated venting and shaming such as this is one of the main reasons I wrote this article...

As I explained, men and women do indeed have DIFFERENT needs and desires in a friend. That does not mean one is more noble or honorable than the other. Although, it may seem that way to one sex or the other, focused on only their own needs and benefits.

Also, as I noted in the research, men and women BOTH have different expectations for opposite sex friends. Yes, men are more likely to be interested in sex or romance from female friends. Women, however, are more likely to look for protection, networking, and paid outings from male "friends". Hence the reason why many men feel women see them as "success objects" and "wallets and bodyguards", rather than human too. Both sexes often see opposite sex friendships as a means to an end...they are just routinely different ends. So, if you are going to label that behavior as "hypocritical" or "sexist", then it goes for both women and men. 

Instead of respecting those differences, however, shaming occurs. That shaming is a manipulation technique to get the other sex to give up on their own goals, for your own good only. For example, your version of moral and "non-sexist" friendship excludes the potential sex/romance (your costs as a woman), but leaves in the potential of the man providing resources, networking, and protection as a "friend" (your benefits as a woman). Not only is that completely satisfying for the woman only, but the shaming punishment of being labeled "sexist" and "unenlightened" doesn't even allow the man to opt out of a "friendship" that doesn't work for him. That doesn't sound like a fair trade to me... 

Rather than shaming men into situations that work only for you at their expense, it might be beneficial to respect their needs as equals. That doesn't mean that you have to have sex or romance with male friends, just as they don't have to pay or protect you. But, simply respecting that their feelings are valid, appropriate, and legitimate can go a long way to establishing friendship...and make you as female = human + friend.</div>

Have you ever stopped to think that some women are simply overvaluing themselves as friendship material, and the guy needs more than she's willing to give? She has the right to choose whoever she sleeps with, and he has the right to choose whoever he wants to be friends with. She doesn't owe him anything, and he owes her nothing. Todd's right. This is coming off as shaming others for voicing legitimate issues, and I'll add a bit entitled.

I'm also not sure why Marilyn Monroe would have been anymore of an expert than, well, anyone? In fact, she was well-known for using and abusing men to get what she wanted.</div>

        <div class="field__item">...and one key phrase jumps out: "in my experience." Perhaps that's not as reliable a guide as the psychological research mentioned in the article? Certainly it doesn't count as "all the evidence."

Let's stipulate one thing up front: we're talking here about heterosexual or at least bisexual people. Same-sex couples/friendships no doubt have issues of their own, but they're not exactly the mismatched goals/lack of communication being described here.

Given that: you seem very comfortable describing how ALL men and ALL women act. For what it's worth, in MY experience, I've encountered quite a lot of variation. I've known more than one woman who does NOT treat male friends as presumptively platonic, and is open to a wide range of possibilities. Likewise, I've known plenty of guys who only have eyes for one woman and would never dream of making a romantic move on anyone else they know.

Nonetheless, I'll grant that those are probably the outliers. It's probably safe to say that for most straight men, any woman pleasant enough to be friends with is also someone they would at least consider, and probably enjoy, having sex with, should the opportunity present itself. 

But what's WRONG with that? There's nothing intrinsically sexist or dehumanizing about it, and it's definitely NOT the same as saying the friendship is merely a means to one particular end and that all else is pretense; only that men conceptualize friendship in a way that does not EXCLUDE the possibility of sex. 

The obvious question here, it seems to me, is why so many women WOULD think of friendship in a way that excludes the possibility. After all, if you're dealing with someone you presumably like and trust and whose company you enjoy, sharing thoughts, feelings, and ideas, why would sharing physical intimacy as well somehow poison the well? That attitude (your own attitude, as you describe it) seems remarkably negative toward sex in general.</div>

        <div class="field__item">Physical intimacy requires a much bigger level of commitment than just hanging out with someone, anyone with half a brain would tell you that. Plus, there are negative social stigmas for being "easy" etc. which only attaches itself to women because of social double standards. On top of that, risk for pregnancy (and the boatload of complications that come with that), STDs, etc. To say you can't see how physical intimacy would "poison the well" shows how very little you seem to know about relationships. You know that issue where "EXes can't be friends"? Adding physical intimacy greatly changes the nature of the relationship, and this change is often irreversible.

"Easy" also has consequences beyond simply a negative social stigma. It can also physically put you in danger if someone decides that "easy" status = their entitlement to your body. Furthermore, should something of that nature happen, you will very likely receive no help or significantly less help from available support groups. And that's if it doesn't also lead to bullying, social ostracization, or get in the way of your financial well-being (hiring opportunities or harassment at work).

Also, I have another issue with only women just seeing men as "wallets" and "protectors". Men also stick up for their male friends in physical altercations. Men also help each other financially, etc. So why is it suddenly when the Y chromosome is not there that this has to come with an expectation of sex as payment instead of mutual support?

Women also have a lot of the same expectations of female friends. Women travel together in numbers for safety and they also help each other out financially whether paying for things or borrowing each other's clothes, etc. Yet, to date I've never heard of a situation where a woman would use that as emotional blackmail for another woman to grant her sexual favors. That's seen as not normal and weird, but from a man's perspective that's seen as a entitlement.

And, both men and women use each other (opposite and same gender connections) for networking. It seems kind of well, silly that you seem to paint it to where only men can offer networking or financial advantages or somehow a financial advantage is something that only women see as beneficial from relationships. It goes both ways and every way. That's the nature of human relations period.

If honestly I had to guess, maybe over exposure to sexual stimulus at starting at a young age perhaps conditions them to see all women as potential outlets for their sexuality. There's also the social norm giving great pressure towards men to be hypersexual for fear of catching "the gay" (though this makes no sense as gay men tend to be pretty active). Where as, comparatively, the amount of pressure for women to do the same is in reverse (until they get to marriage age). Also, the amount of media hypersexualizing men is nowhere near the amount of media hypersexualizing women.

There was actually a study done on this where they compared how people reacted to images of men and women. Men are seen as whole people where as women are seen by their parts. And this reaction occurred in both men and women viewing the images. However, they were able to fix the issue where women were only seen by their parts, which also lead the study to suggest that it had to do with social conditioning via the media.</div>

        <div class="field__item">Anonymous,

I agree with your general observations. Yet, I differ in the explanations for them. Please allow me to explain.

Men and women do enjoy many of the same benefits from various levels of relationship with each other. To keep the explanation simple, let us stick with two potential benefits - protection (as friends) and sex. Both receive added security and protection from being in close proximity to the other as friends. Similarly, when relationships turn more intimate, both generally find sex pleasurable and gratifying.

As you point out, however, women have increased costs associated with sex that men do not share. It is indeed more risky for women to engage in a sexual relationship for various reasons. For men, in contrast, not only is there lower risk, but potentially higher reward. Men's greater levels of testosterone drive them to generally have a higher libido - thus seeking sexual gratification more often. Therefore, although both are having the same sexual need met - women are arguably paying the higher cost and men receiving a greater benefit. Given that cost/benefit discrepancy, a purely sexual (non-friend) exchange between men and women might often be considered unfair for the woman. This is commonly accepted (and noted by your comment)

What is less commonly accepted, is that we have the same problem in reverse when considering a friendship (non-sexual) exchange. In this case, both men and women are indeed receiving a level of protection from the other. However, if a threat occurs, it is more likely that the man will physically protect the woman and become hurt. Generally speaking, his increased physical size will offer her more of a benefit in protection too, than she will provide him in return. Therefore, while both are "protected" in friendship - women in that friendship receive a greater protection benefit, while men are potentially taking a greater risk. Thus, the cost/benefit exchange in the friendship is not equal or fair for the man.

Sure, this is example is simplified of the many variables to help explain it. It is also generalized. So, if one looked hard enough, there could certainly be exceptions. Nevertheless, that does not change the general premise for most opposite-sex friendships... When men and women are non-sexual friends, women receive a greater benefit from that friendship and men a greater risk. This is true, even when BOTH are getting the same needs met - because it is of greater benefit to the woman, and more cost to the man. Adding sex (more costly for the woman, more rewarding for the man) balances it out.

Having said that, I can understand the impulse to disregard this notion. It is advantageous for women to rationalize friendships that benefit them without high costs as "fair" (much as men attempt to rationalize no-strings-attached sex as "fair"). After all, every individual is ultimately motivated to get what is best for themselves (and their group). Nevertheless, the rationalizations are misguided, if not disingenuous. There is a difference between what is truly fair and balanced in both risk and reward...and what simply benefits one group.

Thus, after being educated to this point, that only leaves one question that each person has to ask themselves ... Do they really want to have an equitable relationship and exchange - or would they rather now consciously continue to rationalize their own self-interest as "fair", protect their own ego, and hope an unwitting partner takes the bait? If it is the latter, so be it...but such intentional, biased manipulation of one sex for the benefit of the other will not be supported here.</div>

The cost to women of acquiescing to providing sexual benefits in a "friendship" is 100 units; men's cost in terms of having to protect women, possibly 1 unit over the life of the relationship.

Furthermore, men provide each other back-up without demanding sex from each other.  Let's get real here.</div>

        <div class="field__item">If there are no "female/male specific" requirements, then the trade is fair. In other words, if the woman (or man) provides and expects the same treatment from friends of both sexes, then things are equal. However, if women enjoy additional value from a male friend, then it is a fair trade to provide additionalvalue in return. Vice versa. Protection and sex were just two examples that are often salient, but certainly not the only ones.</div>

If a woman is going to consider you "just a friend" , but she wants to be the recipient of everything and not give in return, it's best to cut bait and run. Don't get emotionally involved. 
As long as you play her games she is not going to stop. 
Cutting off contact is the best thing you can do with a woman like this. She'll either come crawling back to you, or she'll be gone. Either way, it's a good thing for you.</div>

        <div class="field__item">And it's framed in such a way to be misleading. I could say: "Emotional intimacy requires a much bigger level of commitment than casual sex, anyone with half a brain would tell you that." And it would be more accurate. I'd suggest that you ask a prostitute if she gets more commitment from her friends or her clients, but we both know the answer. People don't don't pay for friendships, you know. In fact, we don't even need to go that far. There's no shortage of women who sleep with men on the first, second, third, fourth, etc. date? Is that what you call commitment? After 4 dates, you barely know the guy. Ask a man how it feels when the woman he's been friends with goes and sleeps with the smoothtalker she met a week prior. Someone put it nicely in one of the other posts: she doesn't think he's good enough. So why would he stick around? 

Also, there is no double standard. It's something I hear all the time, yet it's flat-out false. A double standard refers to two parties being treated differently, despite being in the same situation. Except that men and women are not in the same situation. Women control reproduction and, thus, sex. A woman doesn't need to work for sex, while a man does. Broadly speaking of averages, of course. And those social stigmas are usually perpetuated by other women who resent other women who give it up easily because it undermines their leverage over men. It also creates a scenario that isn't likely to exist. If a man is actually friends with the woman who casually sleeps with him once in a while, he's not going to start calling her names like easy and slut: they're friends.</div>

        <div class="field__item">"The obvious question here, it seems to me, is why so many women WOULD think of friendship in a way that excludes the possibility. After all, if you're dealing with someone you presumably like and trust and whose company you enjoy, sharing thoughts, feelings, and ideas, why would sharing physical intimacy as well somehow poison the well? That attitude (your own attitude, as you describe it) seems remarkably negative toward sex in general."

Maybe because the guy is in a situation that, to the woman, doesn't open up to a possible relationship. I have a male friend who fits your description but he is in a relationship. Is there a mutual attraction? Absolutely. We used to be co-workers and were the subject of teasing (which I thought would scare him off...but no). We still keep in touch, have occasional meetings. text, he recently started following me on Twitter and posts to my Facebook. During our last breakfast 'date' we had a 3 hour, very personal conversation (BTW I always offer to pay my own tab...he always refuses to let me). And he admitted what I already knew...that his girlfriend was jealous and actually did not want him to meet with me. That she wanted to marry and he did not. We discussed what we both need out of a relationship. Lots of stuff. We actually have a ton in common.  BUT he is still living with this girl and, to me, that says it all. Even though there is mutual attraction, to my way of thinking, the attraction is not enough to make him 'come over', so in essence, he HAS made a decision.

        <div class="field__item">If one (or both) of the people involved are in another monogamous relationship, then obviously that's an obstacle to sex. I don't think that's quite what I was asking about, though. Indeed it seems from your own example that if the guy in question weren't already "spoken for," you'd be fine with the idea of adding a physical component to your friendship without any fear of it poisoning the well.

On a related point, for what it's worth, I disagree with the original article on how to deal with friendships where that kind of barrier or imbalance *does* exist. Nicholson seems remarkably cavalier about advising people to end friendships and walk away. Yet from your own example, as well as from situations in my life, those I've observed among others, and plenty I can imagine, I'd argue that a good friendship is worth preserving even if it's not a "perfect match" of needs and desires, costs and benefits. 

One isn't really liable to find a lot of perfect matches in life, after all. Yet there's still a mutual investment of emotional energy and effort, and mutual benefits as a result. It's a social norm to argue that a monogamous romantic relationship, if it runs into difficulties, is worth working to save; I'd argue that's just as true of any meaningful friendship. With open, honest communication, there's not much that people can't work out and get past. If someone would rather cut-and-run, that signifies something about how much (or little) that person values friendships in general.

(For similar reasons, although it's a bit of a tangent, I completely disagree with the other poster who contended that "Exes can't be friends." I could offer plenty of counter-examples.)</div>

You socalled men are ridiculous and so is this stupid article that was written by a man who is supposed to have his phd!

        <div class="field__item">I don't think you should lump all men into the same derogatory heap. It's inaccurate to do so. This may be your experience but it's not the experience of everyone. I was in a friendship with a woman. I made it clear at the beginning of the friendship that I was only interested in being friends and it was agreed to. However, this slowly morphed (in the mind of my friend, according to her) into something more. Because I didn't show the proper romantic affection, she eventually stopped talking to me and was extremely hurt and resentful as I was getting what I wanted out of the friendship but she was not. I chalk it up to the fact that she went into it not being completely honest with both me or herself, and she wasn't completely forthcoming with her feelings as they began to change (if that is indeed how it happened). I suspect she thought that my mind would eventually change once I saw what a great person she was, but I never saw her in a romantic light, only as a pal or as a sister.</div>

Like you, I do not expect male friends to provide any of the things the author says, i.e., paying my way, "protecting" me.  As you do, I expect the things from a male friend as I would a female friend.  The problem is that being a woman 9 out of 10 times compartmentalizes you in the mind of a man as a potential romantic partner.  If you are not interested in them in that way, they are no longer interested in your friendship, and that, to me, is the quintessential definition of wanting to use someone.</div>

        <div class="field__item">I think this conversation is not being engaged in honestly, which is based off the premise of some binary logic; being the idea that romantic relationships are of a completely different polar nature then platonic "friendly" relationships, this is a false binary...for both types of relationships are simply "friendships" of varying spectrum. Is friendship not involved in intimacy? or is intimacy not involved in friendship. I hate to break it to some people, but I do not believe that sex equals love. This issue is a problem based on "human" control, which seems to be a universal and none "gendered" objective. But as the author has pointed out, multiple times-there is a difference in gendered tendencies and their idea's as what constitutes a "friendship", and what is "fair" or "ethical" with regards to this subject is obviously in contest. In my humble opinion, everyone has the right to agree to what type of "friendship" they want to be engaged with, no one should be forced into a relationship they don't want to be in-and no one should be guilt tripped into believing that they are being disingenuous for moving away from a relationship they never wanted (it is quite simple really, being that people generally will engage in a relationship that meets their needs; until it doesn't) . People in general often have struggles with what type of relationships (friendships) they deal with...it tends to be a rather fluid situation.</div>

        <div class="field__item">I'll disagree with your last point in the article, about finding people already in relationships for friendship.  That is most likely to lead to accusations of infidelity.  If you were friends before they became a couple, that's usually not such an issue.  Become friends after the fact, and you're a potential rival and love interest that threatens their relationship.  

I agree with your above points that both genders tend to see opposite sex friends differently than same sex friends.  Men generally don't want romance from their male friends, and women generally don't expect their female friends to pay their way or help move a washing machine.  I have met a few of both genders who are just leeches, and for them, friendship is about consuming another person's resources.</div>

        <div class="field__item">I enjoyed this article. I think it is very hard to stay just friends with a male friend simply because we invest in these friendships so much and emotions develop naturally with that. I've often had to re-negotiate such friendships where I would tell a guy I have feelings for him and if he doesn't feel the same then we can't hang out on our own anymore. Sometimes it's been the other way around and I just didn't feel it but then I had to make it clear that perhaps the terms of our friendship should be re-negotiated. 

The thing that worked best for me was I met my husband and traded in all my one to one friendships with other men for the friendship I have with my husband but I never told my husband I wanted to be just friends. Right from the start our intentions were made clear and he also turned out to be the best friend I could have asked for. I'm still friends with the rest but will only meet them in a group.</div>

        <div class="field__item">The idea that men are expected to always pay when out with their female friend seems to be one they hold themselves - and is not necessarily the expectation or desire of the woman. As a woman, I rather pay my own way or reciprocate on another outing, but my efforts are usually trounced and it doesn't serve anyone to put up a fuss at the cashier. It feels as though my paying reflects poorly on their masculinity. Not every woman wants to be in a committed relationship either - and there are stages in her life that it would probably hold her back. 
I do enjoy spending time with my male friends and the nature of the relationship is different from those of close female friends as there does tend to be an under current of attraction or sexual tension. I have two-opposite sex friends who are one of the closest friendships I've had. One from my high school years and one that developed over time with someone I worked closely with during my postdoctoral years - the latter is probably one that has raised eye brows as his initial interest in me was due to his mid-life crisis (my assumption) and dissatisfaction with married life. I will readily admit that I returned his interest, but am quite good with boundaries and valued his insights. Most would have thought it best if we had walked away from each other, but our continued interaction has resulted in very productive outcomes both professionally and personally. Although I left to work in another country, we still communicate and seek feedback from each other regularly (by that I mean 5 out of 7 days a week usually). We talk like close friends, we have hung out as friends, but over the 6 years we've known each other, we've never physically crossed the line.</div>

Not that I mistrust the findings within their particular context, but within the context of my own experience, at least (midwesterner, GenX, professional academic), it's completely routine and indeed expected that everyone will pay his or her own way when out with platonic friends, regardless of gender. (Or, conversely, that if one person's treating to a meal or round of drinks or whatever, the other(s) will reciprocate later... again, regardless of gender.) 

I would frankly be astonished if a female friend expected a non-romantic male friend to pick up her tab after a social outing. Indeed, even most couples I know who ARE romantically linked go dutch most of the time.</div>

That's not realistic. It's a way of thinking that creates unrealistic expectations and codependencies, and has undermined any number of otherwise fine relationships. People are complex creatures, and we benefit from a variety of interactions with a variety of people.</div>

        <div class="field__item">I don't think it perpetuates that idea at all, nor do I think it's destructive to avoid. An emotional affair is about achieving emotional intimacy with someone who isn't your spouse. It's not about having drinks and talking politics at the bar with the opposite sex. I'm using the source from the wiki article, David Moultrup, but an emotional affair is "A relationship between a person and someone other than (their) spouse (or lover) that has an impact on the level of intimacy, emotional distance and overall dynamic balance in the marriage." If your wife is at home nursing the newborn, and you're spending an increasing amount of your time with another woman who stimulates your mind and makes you feel better about yourself than your post-natal wife, you're having an affair.

No one is suggesting that a person get all their needs met from their spouse, but rather that they're actively partaking in behaviour that undermines the expectations of a relationship. Which is fine, since no one should be in a situation that they don't want to be in, but let's call it for what it is. Emotional cheating: breaking the marriage contract by partaking in behaviours that are widely known to initiate romantic feelings and lust. Some can suppress those feelings, but it's unrealistic to think that most people can - regardless of intelligence.

Codependence is a natural, and in many cases beneficial arrangement. Some people don't thrive off that, but there's no shortage of people in the world who do. I'd probably say most do. Physical monogamy is also a manifestation of co-dependence, yet it's neither expected nor realistic, either. Yet we understand that partaking in sexual behaviour outside of a relationship brings destructive consequences - especially if the original relationship is a family.</div>

        <div class="field__item">The problem with the definition of "emotional affair" that you quote is that if one is being honest, *everything* in your life impacts "the level of intimacy, emotional distance, and overall dynamic balance" in a marriage or romantic relationship. Everything, including but not limited to all friendships with other people, both same-sex and opposite sex. 

As for whether that impact "undermines the expectations of a relationship," well, those expectations are internal, and up to the actual participants to determine. Good relationships are built around that, and the communication it involves, and can take a lot of forms... whereas I've seen plenty of (otherwise) good ones torpedoed by outside expectations (real or perceived) of how a relationship "should" be. 

It's not something for outsiders to determine or label. So from the information provided, I'm still inclined to think that what Whimsy described was perfectly fine, and the "good thing you're in another country" remark from the first Anonymous was presumptuous.</div>

        <div class="field__item">One thing that wasn't covered in the article are age differences between men and women who are 'just friends'. I have a co-worker who is quite a bit younger than I. He started exhibiting behaviors that, at first, I thought were platonic. But then I thought...if he were closer to my age and showing these same traits, would I think it was platonic? And the answer is 'No'. And our co-worker tease him about his preference, which I thought would scare him off, but no. It's an unusual thing...our tastes, ways of thinking, even experiences in growing up...all similar. Easy conversation. When we disagree, there is good conflict resolution. We 'fit'. BUT being the realist that I am, I looked at his situation. He is living with a young woman...one of those stereotypical girls that are 'needy' (his words and true...I know her), that won't make a step without him, whom both families and friends expect him to marry. And I realized, yes, he was attracted to me, but not enough to make a stand for what he wanted. And because of that, I have put him in the 'friend zone'.  A woman knows when a man is attracted to her but I also know men go after what they really want. Maybe I'm expecting too much. I don't know how your article (which I mostly agree with) fits this situation.</div>

        <div class="field__item">I normally agree about cutting the friend off if your desires/goals don't match but miraculously there is a male friend who has stayed in the picture defying all odds. 

I have a pretty unique guy story experience. I met my guy friend who I’ll call M while teaching overseas in South Korea so we were both expats. I’m use to most guys just hitting on me or flirting with me so in the past I’ve never really had a guy friend, (and on top of that I’m still a virgin) although no one would ever expect it.

Of course M hit on me right away. He befriended me because he was trying to get me into bed. When I met him he was still technically married but no longer with his wife, AND on top of that he was depressed and sullen from a recent bad breakup with his another women he dated for a year. So he was on the rebound too! We had a lot in common though so started hanging out and he was constantly flirting and making sexual innuendos at me. One weekend we went away just the two of us to an island. We ended up in a love motel, which are special hotels that Koreans go to specifically to have sex but expats go there because their cheap. I was cursing myself for getting into this position because I didn’t want to sleep with him. I liked him, but I didn’t want to lose my virginity as a fling to a guy not over his ex. When in the motel, he suddenly leaped on top of me, straddling me! I was so freaked out by that sudden move, which came out of the blue, (while he was half-naked) I immediately rejected him. I did it quite harshly too and didn’t go into any details as to why. It was very awkward and we had to keep hanging out the rest of the weekend and sleep in the same bed TWO nights without touching the rest of the time. I figured our friendship was totally ruined but he continued to initiate and hang out with me after that weekend. In fact, he seemed to try harder and I think he respected me more! But there was always a tension between us. It was during this time while we continued to hang out that I slowly fell for him. I always liked him, but his issues/problems and how he just wanted a fling kept me from ‘going there’. Anyway, he eventually left Korea to move to Spain and it was around that time, that I began doing weird and strange things! It’s really amazing our friendship survived all this.  While in Korea, we shared at least 3 beds together with no touching (even though by then I wanted something to happen but it was too difficult!) Also he suggested dating at one point in a text three months after I rejected him!!! So I know he thought about me in that way. I brushed it off again though, because I knew he was leaving Korea in about 6 weeks so I figured it wouldn’t work. 

About a week before he left, I started to do weird things. I confessed to him I was a virgin in an email and that it played a part in why I rejected him in the hotel. It went unanswered and I regretted telling him. Then he left and I deleted him from facebook.  He noticed and questioned me about it so I then re-added him. A few months later I deleted him again with a message telling him “That I thought about him ALL the time it was driving me crazy and that I HAD to delete him”…haha. The craziest message anyone could ever send. It went ignored. I then proceeded to send two more messages after that, one that was a long confession revealing that I had feelings for him the entire time and just suppressed it because I didn’t want to just be a fling. It was this sappy “have a nice life” goodbye email. I thought we’d never talk again. But he answered me back, re-added me a second time on facebook and proceeded to invite me to visit him in Spain. The next two months before visiting him, he flirted with me constantly in texts and he also read some poems I wrote that were about him! And he flirted in a sexual way. I had high hopes upon visiting him that something would happen. By this point, I was obsessed and soooo attracted to him. I was SO curious about our chemistry and I had decided I would just sleep with him and have a fling. I didn’t even care at that point.

So I meet him in Spain but he’s SO platonic toward me (despite the flirting and knowing how I felt) He talked about other women and treated me like a sister. It was very difficult because I had expectations that weren’t happening. We also slept in the same room (not the same bed) this time which made it even worse. Finally on the second day, I got the courage to ask him what was up and if he wasn’t curious about our chemistry. He said “no’, that after I rejected him he never thought about me in that way again (which I know is a lie) and that he thought sex would ruin our friendship and he didn’t want to hurt me (or get hurt himself) and that was that. 

I left after three days and no romance or fling of any kind occurred, despite visiting him over Valentine’s day!! How pathetic is that! When I got back, I sent him an accusing email, kind of bitching over why he’d invite me if he planned to be so platonic and that it was annoying. He writes back, kind of getting mad, that he was respecting me, and that we were always just friends, why would I assume. blah, blah…as if it was SO out of the question to assume that something might happen after he flirted with me and invited me to visit AFTER I confessed my interest.  

Anyway, I really thought our friendship was ruined and it was really hard because I had to try to get over him. To do that I have to ignore the person to move on, but he made a point of constantly initiating and keeping in touch and maintaining our friendship and now to this day we are still in contact, long distance through facebook. He usually initiates. But I’m amazed that we came through ALL of that weirdness and managed to stay friends! I guess that’s saying a lot! I still have feelings for him but I’m trying to see him as a friend now.

Who knows if things would have turned differently had we slept together but it is kind of pathetic that I KNOW he’s attracted to me (he wouldn’t have invited me to visit if he wasn’t) yet he pretended he always just saw me as a friend, which I know isn’t true. I could tell he was always attracted to me but for whatever reason (maybe knowing I’m a virgin) he never wanted to act on it. 
But I’ve never stayed friends with a guy after confessing my interest in them! It kind of amazes me…Unfortunately, I think ‘once you are friends, you will always just be friends’..and things never change or suddenly develop into a relationship. In movies it happens but not in real life!

And I do think we can only sustain a partial friendship because it's long distance. If I had to see him everyday, it would be much more difficult.</div>

        <div class="field__item">Men and women cannot be just friends. I will give you facts why.
 In the society people are rudely shared on attractive, average, unattractive. I think that all of us is beautiful on his/her own way. I will use the terms unattractive, attractive rudely without my wish, but by the wish of the world we live in. When man expresses a wish to be friend with woman he always looks forward to "gain" something from that friendship. The last results of the interest can be: sex, relationship... or the woman has friend that he likes. You all are part of the society with its own rudeness. Come on tell me how many socially accepted as unattractive girls do you know who has a lot of male friends who call her all the time wanting to meet her for coffee, walk, tennis? Other example there is male phrase: "Conquer her friends then conquer her". Women are suggestible more than they are self-conscious about it. Her friends can make her do a lot of crazy things and create her opinion (There are exceptions which I honestly admire a lot). Led by this phrase, male gets close to girls. There are bunch of other reasons like making his girlfriend jealous without cheating on her. Male can be honest friend with female if he is gay. Male can be honest friend with female when he is in relationship with her. Again, there are exceptions but I am talking generally. The world is like that.</div>

        <div class="field__item">Can men and women be friends without any feelings arising? In theory, absolutely. In practice, well, I think it's a bit naive to think that because it does happen that you can apply it on a mass scale. I often hear (usually from) women lamenting how men want to cross that barrier, but I do think there's a fundamental lack of empathy when assuming that men, with a completely different reproductive strategy, view the opposite sex in the same way as they do.

For starters, there's quite a bit of research to support the idea that women socially bond to others more through the verbal side of relationships, while males do so through physical means (original division of labour). If true, it certainly suggests that women get more out of the average male-female relationship than men. Curiously, it also begs the question of whether opposite-sex activity partners (ie. playing sports) would fulfill that criteria for men.

At the same time, if we're being mercenary about where we invest our social resources, in a world in which it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep a long-term mate, it doesn't seem like a particularly good idea for a man to divert emotional resources away from his partner to another woman. From an evolutionary point of view, it makes perfect sense for a woman to maximize her genes by maintaining close emotional ties to many men. More potential providers (whether it's financial or emotional, or even manifested as a potential protector or alloparent). Here's where the discontinuity comes in, though. It's a conflict of interest to a man's current mate, though, as an emotional connection to another woman runs the risk of diverting resources from her potential off-spring to another woman's. In other words, it helps propagate a potential rival's genes at the cost of hers. The risk of emotional cheating is high, and I suspect most women fear that more than physical cheating. 

This type of view seems callous, but I don't think it's very far from the truth. There's also significant cognitive dissonance on my part here - more so between my emotions and my reason. Even though my best connections have been with ex-girlfriends over the years, the female friendships have also been my least fulfilling interpersonal relationships in the sense that I always felt as though my physical needs weren't being met. Those are my priorities, and I certainly don't apologize for it. In fact, I don't think I'm that different from most men under 35.

For me, at least, I tend to keep women in the acquaintance category for this reason. When a woman relegates me to the friend-zone, and I want more, the logical conclusion is that she doesn't think I'm good enough to be her mate - regardless of what her reasoning is, it's true in practical terms (not including contextual situations like bad timing). In other words, she has set the bar at a certain criteria for potential mates, and doesn't feel that I meet it. Sticking around and continuing to build up an emotional connection to a dead-end affects my emotional availability elsewhere, and it's more efficient to keep them as a network rather than an inner circle.</div>

        <div class="field__item">That's an interesting analysis, and I suspect there is some truth to it.  The strategies certainly sound correct.  However, mostly that is going to come into play when one or both parties is actually seeking a mate.  I've had friendships with men that worked just fine when we were all unattached and not seeking mates.  Getting together for movies, board games, etc, worked just fine.  My brother's group of college buddies was good for this.  However, let any one of them get a girlfriend, and the things you note start coming into play.  She wants him to "grow up and stop playing with his little friends" and pay attention to her.  If she finds out there are females in the group, then either she wants to take over the group and be the queen, or she wants to "ride herd" and make sure none of the females pay attention to her man, which is most easily accomplished by diverting his attention and trying to make him give up his former friends.  It will be interesting to see how that goes, now that people are less interested in permanent attachment to one mate.</div>
