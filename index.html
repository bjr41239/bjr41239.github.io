<h1 STYLE= "TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER">Can Men and Women Just Be Friends? </h1> 
<div style="text-align:CENTER"> 
<img src="men-women.jpg" alt= "Men and Women"> </div>
<p>It is the age old question. Can men and women simply be friends? Is it possible to create and maintain a strictly platonic relationship with the opposite sex or is it innate for men and women to form emotional bonds with one another despite the title placed on the relationship? 
	    In the world of relationships, this is a controversial topic. Figuring out the ‘status’ of your relationship with a friend can be extremely nerve wrecking but it is necessary to clearly define the relationship and establish boundaries.</p>

<h2 class="example1"> Setting Those Boundaries </h2>	
<P> It is important for individuals of the opposite sex to establish clear boundaries for communication and interaction. Whether you claim a romantic partner or you and your friend are satisfied and single, it is vital for both of your emotional health to ask <I>"What type of friend am I supposed to be to my friend at this point in our lives?" </I> 
	Am I supposed to be their motivator, their hobby guru or their carpool buddy?  Discovering the purpose of your friendship will help you determine how you should interact with that individual. 
	For instance, if the purpose of my friendship with my guy friend is to motivate each other while exercising, our interaction would include going to the gym together, reminding each other to eat a balanced diet and encouraging each other when workouts gradually get more difficult. 
	Anything outside of these activities does not demonstrate the purpose of our friendship. </p>
<h2 class="example1"> Honesty is Key! </h2>
<P> Let's say you may begin to develop feelings for your friend and you do not know how to handle it? (Spoiler Alert! This happens more than you think!) The key thing in these situations is <B> HONESTY! </B> Friendships should first be built on trust. You have to trust your friend enough to share your honest opinions and vice versa. Begin by having a conversation about how you feel. 
	I have learned through experience that true friends create an environment for you to honest without judgement or ridicule. Simply tell your friend what you are feeling and begin to face the music after the fact. The biggest fear I think people face in these cases are rejection. We fear our friend does not feel the same way. We fear our friendship will end. 
	But there are times in life where we have to do things afraid. It is okay to feel scared but do not let that fear hinder you from progressing and moving forward. For those of you still a bit apprehensive about having this type of conversation, especially if another party is involved, here are some helpful ways to start the conversation! </p>

	the most important thing to recognize is how you feel about the people in your life.

	<th class="example1"> If your friend is not single
	<td><p> “I am coming to you because we are friends and I want us to be honest about how we are feeling. 
	I have realized that I have feelings for you and I wanted to be the one to tell you. I know you are 
	involved in a relationship and I respect you and your partner. Where do you think we should go from here?”
	<td><p> This can be a bit tricky. Having feelings for someone besides your significant other can be uncomfortable territory. If you and your friend have feelings for each other, a conversation needs to occur about how to address these feelings and move forward.
